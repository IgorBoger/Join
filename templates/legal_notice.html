            <h3>Liability for Content</h3>
            The contents of our pages were created with the greatest care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy,
            completeness,
            and timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages
            according to § 7
            Abs.1 TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored
            third-party information
            or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of
            information under the
            general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of
            knowledge of a concrete
            legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such legal violations, we will remove this content
            immediately.<br><br>
            <h3>Liability for Links</h3>
            Our offer contains links to external third-party websites, over whose content we have no influence.
            Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of
            the pages is always
            responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations
            at the time of
            linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. A permanent content control of the
            linked pages is,
            however, not reasonable without concrete indications of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal
            violations, we will
            remove such links immediately.<br><br>
            <h3>Copyright</h3>
            The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law.
            The duplication, processing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright
            require the written
            consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for
            private, non-commercial use.
            Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are
            respected. In particular,
            third-party content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement,
            please inform us
            accordingly. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such content
            immediately.<br><br>
            <h3>Data Protection</h3>
            The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. As far as personal data (e.g.,
            name, address, or
            email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis whenever possible. This
            data will not be
            passed on to third parties without your explicit consent.<br>
            We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating via email)
            can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.<br>
            The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation by third parties for sending
            unsolicited
            advertising and information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly
            reserve the
            right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam
            emails.<br><br>
            <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
            This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google
            Analytics
            uses so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer and that enable an analysis of your
            use of the
            website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website (including your IP address)
            is transmitted
            to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the
            website, to
            compile reports on website activity for website operators, and to provide other services related to website
            activity and
            internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties if required by law or if third
            parties process
            this data on behalf of Google. Google will never associate your IP address with other Google data. You can
            prevent the
            installation of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, we point out that in this
            case, you may
            not be able to fully use all the functions of this website. By using this website, you consent to the
            processing of data
            about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.<br><br>
            <h3>Google AdSense</h3>
            This website uses Google AdSense, a web advertising service of Google Inc., USA ("Google"). Google AdSense
            uses so-called
            "cookies" (text files), which are stored on your computer and enable an analysis of your use of the website.
            Google AdSense
            also uses so-called "web beacons" (small invisible graphics) to collect information. By using the web
            beacon, simple actions
            such as visitor traffic on the website can be recorded and collected. The information generated by the
            cookie and/or web beacon
            about your use of this website (including your IP address) is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and
            stored there. Google
            will use this information to evaluate your use of the website concerning ads, to compile reports on website
            activity and ads for
            website operators, and to provide other services related to website and internet usage. Google may also
            transfer this information
            to third parties if required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google. Google will
            never associate your
            IP address with other Google data.
